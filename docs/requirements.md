✅ 1. Functional Requirements (FRs)

These describe what the system should do.

Functional Requirements for AI Architecture Assistant

The system shall allow the user to input a project idea or system description.

The system shall analyze the user input using rule-based techniques + NLP.

The system shall identify the type of software system (web, mobile, embedded, enterprise, etc.).

The system shall generate recommended architecture styles based on rules.

The system shall identify actors for the system described by the user.

The system shall generate use cases based on user input.

The system shall suggest suitable class diagram structure (classes, attributes, relationships).

The system shall suggest an ER diagram (entities, attributes, relationships).

The system shall provide system workflow or sequence of operations.

The system shall recommend quality attributes (performance, security, availability).

The system shall allow users to refine or modify their project description.

The system shall provide detailed explanations for each architecture suggestion.

The system shall store predefined rule sets for architecture decisions.

The system shall log user queries and outputs for future accuracy improvements.

The system shall allow the user to export results (PDF/Doc or plain text).

✅ 2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

These describe how the system should behave.

Non-Functional Requirements
Performance

The system shall respond to user queries within 3 seconds.

Rule-based evaluations shall execute with minimal delay.

Usability

The system interface shall be simple and easy to use.

The system shall support natural language input.

The system shall provide clear explanations in simple English (as you prefer).

Reliability

The system shall operate with 99% uptime.

The system shall prevent system crashes through validation checks.

Security

The system shall not store sensitive personal data.

Access to admin rule-editing panel shall be password protected.

Maintainability

Rules must be easy to add, remove, or update without modifying core system code.

System must follow modular software design for easy updates.

Scalability

The system must handle increased users without performance degradation.

✅ 3. System Constraints

Must be rule-based + lightweight NLP (no full GPT-like models).

Must run on standard hardware (laptop/local server).

Must use open-source libraries only.

Must include a knowledge base of architecture rules.

Must use simple UI (web or desktop).

Must produce diagrams in text format (PlantUML, Mermaid) — no complex rendering needed.
