1. Overview

This document describes the REST API endpoints used by the AI Architecture Assistant Tool.
The backend exposes a single primary endpoint:

       POST /chat
This endpoint receives a user message, sends it to the Chatbot Core, and returns an AI-generated response

 . Base URL

During local development:   " http://localhost:8000 "

🔵 POST /chat
Description

Receives a user message and returns a chatbot response generated by the NLP Engine + Architecture Engine.

Request Format

Headers:  Content-Type: application/json
Body (JSON): {
  "message": "generate class diagram for an online library"
}
Response Format

Success Response (200 OK):
  {
  "response": "Here is your class diagram..."
}

Error Response (400 Bad Request):
    {
  "error": "Invalid request."
}

Server Error (500 Internal Server Error):
   {
  "error": "Unexpected server error."
}

4. Internal Workflow

When /chat is called:

         User message
              ↓
      Backend /chat endpoint
              ↓
         Chatbot Core
              ↓
      NLP Engine identifies intent
              ↓
    Correct intent handler (architecture, diagram, pattern, database)
              ↓
    Architecture Engine executes request
              ↓
     Response returned to the user

5. Data Validation Rules

"message" must be a string

Empty messages return a friendly error

Backend sanitizes input to prevent malicious payloads

6. Rate Limiting (Optional Future Enhancement)

Planned features:

Max 20 messages/min per user

IP-based throttling

Token-based authentication

7. Response Time Targets

To ensure a good UX:

Average response time: < 800ms

Maximum allowed: < 2 seconds

8. Error Codes

Status Code  	Meaning
200	          Successful response
400	         Bad request (missing message field)
404	        Endpoint not found
500	        Server error

9.Future API Expansion

    /generate/diagram

    /generate/architecture

     /generate/database

     /export/pdf

     User accounts & saved projects
